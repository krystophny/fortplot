**Date**: 2025-08-25T08:52:41+02:00
**Branch**: fix-rescue-backlog-commits-293

### Investigation Results

1. **Missing Commit Identified**: 
   - Commit: 9e25c21 "update: move issue #269 to DONE - scale system implementation completed"
   - Status: Issue #269 already correctly marked as DONE in current BACKLOG.md

2. **Current State**: BACKLOG.md is accurate and up-to-date

3. **Safeguards Implemented**:
   - Pre-commit hook for BACKLOG.md validation
   - Rescue script: scripts/rescue_backlog_commits.sh
   - Synchronization script: scripts/sync_backlog_state.sh

### Rescue Actions Taken

- Validated all GitHub issue references in BACKLOG.md
- Checked consistency between GitHub issues and BACKLOG.md state
- Created backup: [0;32m[INFO][0m Created backup: BACKLOG.md.backup.20250825_085213
BACKLOG.md.backup.20250825_085213
- Implemented prevention measures

### Recommendations

1. Always use the rescue scripts before major BACKLOG.md operations
2. Run sync_backlog_state.sh periodically to detect inconsistencies
3. Use targeted commits for BACKLOG.md updates (git add BACKLOG.md)
