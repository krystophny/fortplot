# MPEG Implementation Status

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Memory operations (fortplot_mpeg_memory.f90)
  - Fixed partial file I/O position calculations (Fortran 1-based indexing)
  - All memory tests passing
- Stream I/O basic operations (fortplot_mpeg_stream.f90)
  - Bit reading/writing with correct C-compatible bit masks
  - Flush behavior (both 1s and 0s) matching C implementation
- Huffman encoding/decoding (fortplot_mpeg_huffman.f90)
  - DC/AC coefficient encoding
  - Roundtrip validation

### üîß In Progress
- Stream seek operations 
  - Analyzed C implementation in thirdparty/mpeg/stream.c
  - C uses simple sequential byte writing with putc()
  - C seek: flush, seek to byte position, read existing byte, mask, position for write
  - Current Fortran attempt: positioned writes but missing final positioning step

### ‚ùå Current Issue
- Test expects: 11100111, getting: 10100000
- Root cause: After seek+read, file pointer positioning for subsequent write
- Need to replicate C's fseek() behavior exactly in Fortran

### üìù Next Steps
1. Simplify seek implementation to match C exactly
2. Use standard Fortran stream positioning 
3. Implement DCT/IDCT transforms
4. Complete codec implementation
5. Motion estimation
6. Full encoding pipeline

## Technical Analysis

**C Implementation Key Points:**
- `putc(current_write_byte, swout)` - sequential byte writing
- `mwseek()`: flush ‚Üí seek to end ‚Üí get length ‚Üí seek to target ‚Üí read byte ‚Üí mask ‚Üí seek back
- Simple state: current_write_byte, write_position (7 to 0)

**Fortran Challenges:**
- No direct equivalent to C's fseek() without I/O
- Positioned reads advance file pointer  
- Need careful positioning for write after read

**Solution Direction:**
Replicate C behavior step-by-step using standard Fortran stream I/O positioning.
