# Development Backlog

## CURRENT SPRINT (Critical PNG/PDF Rendering Issues)

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: User-visible PNG/PDF rendering completely broken**
- [ ] #311: Simple Sine Wave and Gaussian Default plots shows just axes in examples but no content
- [ ] #312: Legend Demo plots dont show up on github pages

**Infrastructure & Documentation Issues (Lower Priority)**

## DOING (Current Work)
- [x] #272: fix: rescue BACKLOG.md commits from main branch protection (branch: fix-rescue-backlog-commits-272, PR: #314)

## BLOCKED (Infrastructure Issues)

## FUTURE SPRINTS - Systematic Restoration

**Sprint 2: PNG Rendering Quality Restoration**
- PNG antialiasing system restoration
- Line styles and markers pipeline fixes
- Color accuracy improvements

**Sprint 3: PDF Coordinate System Overhaul**  
- Coordinate transformation restoration
- Scaling and positioning fixes
- Page layout system improvements

**Sprint 4: Cross-Backend Integration**
- Legend system restoration
- Consistent rendering across backends
- Text and label positioning fixes

**Sprint 5: Quality Assurance & Testing**
- Visual regression testing framework
- Automated quality metrics
- Performance impact validation
