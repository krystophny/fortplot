    !! RED PHASE: Test specifically targeting the render_figure() pipeline gap
    !!
    !! ISSUE #179 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
    !! 1. Annotation storage works: annotations added to figure%annotations(:)
    !! 2. Backend text() methods work: used successfully by other components
    !! 3. THE GAP: render_figure() never calls any annotation rendering code
    !!
    !! Expected test flow:
    !! 1. Annotations get stored ✓
    !! 2. savefig() calls render_figure() ✓  
    !! 3. render_figure() renders background, axes, plots, legend ✓
    !! 4. render_figure() should call render_annotations() ✗ MISSING!
    !! 5. render_annotations() should call backend%text() for each annotation ✗ MISSING!
    !!
    !! This test demonstrates the exact location of the missing code.
