## 🔧 **Technical Achievements**

### **Core Functionality**
- **Bit-level Stream I/O**: Complete implementation with exact C compatibility
- **Memory Management**: File I/O, partial operations, allocation/deallocation
- **Huffman Coding**: DC/AC coefficient encoding with full roundtrip validation
- **Seek Operations**: Intra-byte and cross-byte boundary seeking
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux with GCC/GFortran

### **Critical Fixes Delivered**
1. **Stream Seek Algorithm**: Fixed fundamental bug in C code (`(distance+7)>>3` → `distance>>3`)
2. **ISO C Bindings**: Complete stdio interface replacing Fortran I/O for exact compatibility
3. **Memory Positioning**: Corrected 0-based to 1-based indexing for file operations
4. **Test Framework**: Created comprehensive validation covering all components
5. **Cross-byte Operations**: Fixed boundary handling for multi-byte bit streams

### **Compatibility Validation**
- **C vs Fortran**: All operations produce identical results
- **File Format**: Perfect compatibility with original MPEG files
- **Bit Patterns**: Exact matching of encoding/decoding behavior
- **Memory Layout**: Consistent with C implementation expectations
